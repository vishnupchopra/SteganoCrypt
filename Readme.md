## ✨ Features

### 🔒 **Secure Message Hiding**
- Hide secret messages invisibly within image files
- Optional password protection with XOR encryption
- Support for messages up to 500 characters
- Maintains original image quality

### 👁️ **Message Revelation**
- Extract hidden messages from steganographic images
- Password-protected decryption when applicable

- Fully responsive layout (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Intuitive tab-based navigation
- Real-time image previews
- Drag-and-drop style file selection

### 🔧 **Technical Excellence**
- **LSB Steganography**: Uses RGB color channels for data hiding
- **Multiple Formats**: Supports PNG, JPG, and JPEG files
- **Client-Side Processing**: Complete privacy - no data sent to servers
- **Cross-Browser Compatible**: Works on all modern browsers
- **No Dependencies**: Pure vanilla JavaScript implementation

## 📋 How It Works

### Hiding a Message (Encoding)
1. **Select Cover Image**: Choose a PNG/JPG image to hide your message in
2. **Enter Secret Message**: Type your confidential message (max 500 chars)
3. **Add Password** (Optional): Enhance security with password protection
4. **Generate**: Click "Hide Message in Image" to create the steganographic image
5. **Download**: Save the encoded image with your hidden message

### Revealing a Message (Decoding)
1. **Upload Encoded Image**: Select the image containing the hidden message
2. **Enter Password** (If Used): Provide the password used during encoding
3. **Extract**: Click "Reveal Hidden Message" to decode the secret
4. **View Result**: Your hidden message will be displayed

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

### Option 1: Direct Use
1. Download the `index.html` file
2. Open it in any modern web browser
3. Start hiding and revealing messages immediately!

### Option 2: Local Development
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/steganocrypt.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd steganocrypt

# Open in browser
open index.html
# or
python -m http.server 8000  # For local server
```

### Option 3: GitHub Pages
1. Fork this repository
2. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
3. Access your live version at `https://your-username.github.io/steganocrypt`

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Steganography Algorithm
- **Method**: LSB (Least Significant Bit) manipulation
- **Channels**: RGB color channels (excludes alpha)
- **Capacity**: ~3 bits per pixel (1 bit per color channel)
- **Delimiter**: Uses "###END###" marker for message boundaries

### Security Features
- **Encryption**: XOR cipher with user-provided password
- **Data Integrity**: Message delimiter ensures complete extraction
- **Privacy**: All processing happens client-side

### Browser Support
- ✅ Chrome 60+
- ✅ Firefox 55+
- ✅ Safari 12+
- ✅ Edge 79+

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Secure Communication**: Send confidential messages hidden in innocent images
- **Digital Watermarking**: Embed copyright or ownership information
- **Educational Projects**: Learn about steganography and information security
- **Privacy Protection**: Communicate sensitive information covertly
- **Data Backup**: Hide important text data within image files

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Limitations
- **Message Length**: Maximum 500 characters per image
- **Image Size**: Larger images can hold longer messages
- **Format Support**: PNG recommended for best results (lossless)
- **Compression**: JPEG compression may affect hidden data integrity

### Security Considerations
- **Password Strength**: Use strong passwords for sensitive messages
- **Image Sharing**: Be aware that anyone with the tool can attempt to decode
- **Steganographic Detection**: Advanced tools may detect presence of hidden data
- **Not Cryptographically Secure**: Suitable for privacy, not high-security applications
